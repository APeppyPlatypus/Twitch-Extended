[b][ IF YOU HAVE GOKI'S THINGS INSTALLED MAKE SURE THIS MOD IS ABOVE IT IN THE MODS LIST ][/b]

When Goki's Things is installed a new Twitch Extended tab will be added to Goki's config menu.
Currently in this tab you can enable loadout voting.
Do not enable Loadouts in Goki's Things when using this feature. 
(You can however disable and enable individual loadouts through Goki's config menu)
